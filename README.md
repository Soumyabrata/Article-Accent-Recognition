# Article-Accent-Recognition

These files are the contributions of the article. 

For the dataset, I have used audio samples that can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/speech-accent-archive.
GitHub doesn't allow me to give you all the spectrogram files generated, so I decided to give you at max 100 of each accent as an example. If you need all of it, feel free to use the dataset present on y personal Kaggle profile : https://www.kaggle.com/pberjon/accent-data.
Each Python Notebook gives one contribution of the article (and one model I have used).
